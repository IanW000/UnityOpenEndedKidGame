6. Recreated animation in Unity with original source files
  ● Achieved by codes - Falling leaves, Sun, Sloud, Trees Spawning fruits, Chest spawning gems, Dropping & Throwing objects
  ● Achieved by animator controller - Character (idle, sitting, singing), Trees, Brush, Chest, Visual Instruction

## Things I’d like to mention or highlight
1. Try to drag the character and drop it on the other objects to trigger different character
events!
2. The sun’s face is always facing the mouse’s location.
3. There’s some visual instruction to help you know which objects can be interacted with.
Ex. cursor outlook will be changed if hovering on interactable objects, dragging the
character will let interactable objects have a color animation
4. I reused some codes in the previous assignment for building the physics system and UI
5. The total hour to finish this project is around 16 hrs.
